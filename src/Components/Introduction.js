					Common houseplants are usually tropical or semi-tropical epiphytes, 
					succulents or cacti. Houseplants need the correct moisture, 
					light levels, soil mixture, temperature, and humidity. As well, 
					houseplants need the proper fertilizer and correct-sized pots.
				</p>

				<p>
					A good go-to option for identifying plants is our app PlantSnap. 
					This app identifies flowers and leaves using a photo-identification algorithm. 
					It can take a bit of practice to frame the photo correctly, 
					but the app is excellent for identifying houseplants in seconds
